# Discord.py Mod bot
A discord moderation bot made for a school project using Discord.py
## !! - This Repo is a Work in Progress - !!

## Setup
In order to run the files you need a couple of things
1. A working version of python. We used 3.10.3+
2. The modules in reqs.txt
   - These can be installed using the command prompt once Python is installed
   1. Open your file explorer in the cloned directory
   2. Type or copy paste 'py -m pip install -r reqs.txt'
3. For use. You need to set up a .env file containing your bot's secret token 

   (Which can be retrieved on [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
   - This file MUST be in the same directory as the bot.py file
5. Invite your bot to your own server
6. Enjoy
